It was decommissioned long ago and then re-used by some survivors during the CSAT invasion two years ago. The defending EUROFORCE units were surrounded and outnumbered by CSAT but they held the line. Word says that more than 1000 men died trying to take this fucking rock. But that's just rumours I guess. Now we're using it. It's quite hard to find, has a lot of space, is easy to defend and there are not so many mines around."
